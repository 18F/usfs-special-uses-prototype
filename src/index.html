            <h1>Get started with special-use permits for broadband</h1>

            <h2>This website will guide you through the process of initiating a proposal for a special-use permit.</h2>

            <p>You will be asked to provide information about your broadband project. We
            will use this information to help you complete and submit form SF-299, along
            with additional documents that you will need to support your proposal.</p>

            <h3>What happens after I submit the form?</h3>

            <p>A member of the Forest Service National Broadband Team will contact you to help you complete your proposal.</p>

            <p>After your proposal is complete,</p>

            <ol>
            <li>The proposal will pass through a screening process to check that it is eligible for a special-use permit.</li>

            <li>If the proposal is accepted, it will become an application. The application
            will undergo additional review, such as environmental review, that is specific
            to the proposed project and location.</li>

            <li>If your application is approved, you will be issued a permit.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>How long this process takes depends on many factors, including the location
            and complexity of your proposed project.</p>

            <p>You can find more information about this process on the <a
            href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/specialuses/special_app_process.shtml">Forest
            Service special-uses website</a>.</p>

            <h3>Tips and reminders</h3>

            <ul>

            <li>The best way to help the proposal screening process move more quickly is to
            provide complete and accurate information about your project.</li>

            <li>The Forest Service advises that you do not begin work on any project that
            requires a special-use authorization until a permit has been issued.</li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Who can I contact for help?</h3>

            <p>For help, contact the National Broadband Action Team at <a
