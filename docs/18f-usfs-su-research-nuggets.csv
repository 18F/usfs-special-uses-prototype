It’s a matter of finding funding that matches up with your timeframe and contract support that matches up with the timeframe. One of the unfortunate things for 18F is we didn’t have all the pieces in place. We had that team, but not the other contract developer teams, we didn’t have the product owner. It took a long time to get those piece in line. If you have that for SUDS your job will be much easier. The funding and the contracting was the hard part.

If somebody doesn’t work out, you have to be prepared to be without that role for a while. Had a month without a developer and we needed more design time. You have to be willing to speak up for what you need and push for it. Do have folks managing contract support side and that’s new for us. It’s getting better, have to be prepared for lag times. If you need someone new, you’ll find yourself hurting at a key time. We learned to pay attention to that, and trust that you need someone new. Keep our eye on contract support and not think it’s going to resolve itself. Contractors will tell you they have someone available - but they don’t tell you it won’t take 1.5 months to onboard.

This person is telling me they have 3 projects and having a hard time working with them and then told by staffing that they’re 100%.
